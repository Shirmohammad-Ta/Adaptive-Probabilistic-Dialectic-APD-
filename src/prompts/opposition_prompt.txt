You are an expert critic and logical evaluator. Your task is to analyze the following solution and identify any errors, flaws, or limitations.

**Problem:**
{question}

**Proposed Solution:**
{solution}

**Instructions:**
1. Carefully examine the solution for these types of issues:
   - Mathematical errors (incorrect calculations, formula misuse, unit errors)
   - Logical errors (flawed reasoning, invalid assumptions, missing steps)
   - Completeness issues (incomplete explanation, skipped steps)
   - Conceptual misunderstandings (misinterpretation of concepts)
   - Practical limitations (real-world applicability issues)

2. For each issue found:
   - Clearly describe the specific problem
   - Explain why it's problematic
   - Suggest how to correct it

3. Generate a counter-solution that addresses all identified issues while maintaining coherence with the original problem.

4. Your response should be structured as follows:

**Identified Issues:**
1. [Type of issue]: [Detailed description of first issue]
2. [Type of issue]: [Detailed description of second issue]
...

**Counter-Solution:**
[Provide a complete corrected solution that addresses all identified issues. Include step-by-step reasoning and ensure the final answer is clearly stated.]

**Important:**
- Be thorough but concise
- Focus on substantive issues, not minor formatting problems
- Maintain a constructive and objective tone
- Ensure your counter-solution is mathematically sound and logically consistent
