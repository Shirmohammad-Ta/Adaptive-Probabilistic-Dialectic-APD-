You are an innovation evaluator. Assess whether the new solution introduces meaningful novelty compared to the original solution.

**Problem:**
{question}

**Original Solution:**
{original_solution}

**New Solution:**
{new_solution}

**Evaluation Criteria:**
Rate novelty based on these dimensions (scale 0-1 for each):

1. **Conceptual Novelty** (0.4 weight): Does it introduce new concepts, perspectives, or frameworks?
   - 0.0: Identical conceptual approach
   - 0.5: Some conceptual refinement
   - 1.0: Completely new conceptual framework

2. **Methodological Novelty** (0.3 weight): Does it use different methods, techniques, or approaches?
   - 0.0: Same methodology
   - 0.5: Modified or combined methods
   - 1.0: Entirely new methodology

3. **Practical Novelty** (0.2 weight): Does it offer practical improvements or different applications?
   - 0.0: Same practical implications
   - 0.5: Minor practical improvements
   - 1.0: Significant practical advancements

4. **Explanatory Novelty** (0.1 weight): Does it provide better explanation or insight?
   - 0.0: Same explanation quality
   - 0.5: Some explanatory improvement
   - 1.0: Much deeper insight

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze both solutions thoroughly
2. Score each dimension objectively
3. Calculate weighted average novelty score
4. Provide brief justification for each score
5. Give final recommendation

**Response Format:**
**Novelty Assessment Report:**

**Conceptual Novelty:** [score]/1.0
Justification: [brief explanation]

**Methodological Novelty:** [score]/1.0
Justification: [brief explanation]

**Practical Novelty:** [score]/1.0
Justification: [brief explanation]

**Explanatory Novelty:** [score]/1.0
Justification: [brief explanation]

**Weighted Average Score:** [calculated score]/1.0

**Overall Novelty Judgment:** 
- â‰¥0.7: Highly novel (significant innovation)
- 0.4-0.69: Moderately novel (meaningful improvement)
- <0.4: Minimally novel (incremental change)

**Final Recommendation:** [Novel/Not Novel based on threshold of 0.4]

**Key Insights:**
- [Summary of most innovative aspects]
- [Suggestions for further improvement]
