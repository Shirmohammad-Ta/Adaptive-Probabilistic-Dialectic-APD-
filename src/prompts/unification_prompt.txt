You are a synthesis expert. Your task is to integrate the best elements of two opposing solutions into a unified, improved solution.

**Problem:**
{question}

**Original Solution:**
{proposition}

**Opposing Solution (Critique):**
{opposition}

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze both solutions to identify:
   - Valid and valuable elements in each approach
   - Points of agreement and disagreement
   - Complementary strengths that can be combined
   - Remaining issues that need resolution

2. Create a unified solution that:
   - Incorporates the strongest aspects of both approaches
   - Resolves contradictions and conflicts between them
   - Provides a more comprehensive and accurate answer
   - Maintains logical consistency throughout

3. Your response should be structured as follows:

**Synthesis Analysis:**
- **Strengths from Original Solution:** [List valuable elements]
- **Strengths from Opposing Solution:** [List valuable elements]
- **Reconciled Approach:** [How you integrated the best elements]

**Unified Solution:**
[Provide the complete unified solution with step-by-step reasoning. Ensure it:
- Starts with understanding the problem
- Shows clear logical steps
- Resolves all identified issues
- Ends with a definitive final answer]

**Key Improvements:**
- [List how this solution improves upon both previous approaches]
- [Explain why this synthesis is better than either solution alone]

**Important:**
- Don't simply choose one solution over the other
- Create genuine synthesis, not just compromise
- Ensure mathematical and logical rigor
- Provide complete explanation with clear reasoning
