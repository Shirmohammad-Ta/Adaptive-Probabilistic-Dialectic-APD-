A novel framework for enhancing Large Language Model reasoning through Hegelian dialectical processes combined with adaptive probabilistic methods.

---

## 🎯 Overview

APD implements a self-reflective dialectical process inspired by Hegelian philosophy (Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis) with modern machine learning techniques. The framework enables LLMs to:

- **Self-criticize** and identify errors in their own reasoning  
- **Generate opposing perspectives** to challenge initial solutions  
- **Synthesize improved solutions** through adaptive temperature scheduling  
- **Optimize computation** via Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) for early stopping  

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **🤖 Multi-Model Support**: GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4-32k with optimized configurations  
- **🎛️ Adaptive Temperature Control**: Dynamic exploration-exploitation balance based on novelty metrics  
- **📊 Objective Novelty Assessment**: Semantic similarity-based novelty measurement  
- **⏱️ Optimal Stopping**: SPRT for efficient computation allocation  
- **📈 Comprehensive Evaluation**: Quantitative and qualitative analysis tools  
- **🔧 Modular Architecture**: Easily extensible components

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/APD.git
cd APD

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
# Basic Usage
from src.apd_core import APDDialectic
from config_loader import ConfigLoader

# Initialize with model-specific configuration
loader = ConfigLoader()
config = loader.get_config("gpt4o")

apd = APDDialectic(
    model_name=config['model']['name'],
    tau_min=config['apd_parameters']['tau_min'],
    tau_max=config['apd_parameters']['tau_max'],
    gamma=config['apd_parameters']['gamma']
)

# Run dialectical process
result = apd.run_dialectic(
    initial_question="What is 15% of 200?",
    initial_solution="15% of 200 is 30."
)

print(f"Final solution: {result['final_solution']}")
print(f"Iterations: {result['total_iterations']}")
```

## 🔬 Research Basis

APD integrates concepts from:

- **Hegelian Dialectics** (Thesis–Antithesis–Synthesis)  
- **Sequential Probability Ratio Test** (Optimal stopping)  
- **Simulated Annealing** (Temperature scheduling)  
- **Semantic Similarity** (Novelty measurement)  

---

## 🚧 Limitations and Future Work

**Current Limitations**  
- Dependency on external LLM APIs  
- Limited to text-based reasoning tasks  
- Requires careful prompt engineering  

**Planned Enhancements**  
- Support for local LLM models  
- Multi-modal capabilities  
- Automated prompt optimization  
- Real-time adaptation learning
